# Introduction to HTML5

GitHub Markdown, with Additional HTML rendered in GitHub ReadMe.md files.
- Note, other programs use Markdown for formatting a variety of messages. Markdown is much easier to use if you are used to it or have a "Summary Sheet".
- "Opens a students world to a new type of formatting."
- "Project External Documentation"

Creating Single Page Applications (static or dynamic websites)
- Goal: host at least one through GitHub Website Hosting, further introduction to Google Analytics and Keywords to link to searches
- Using HTML & inline CSS
- "The front end of project promotion."

Modern Examples of Websites, not promotional or business-style, worth researching and learning how to code
- Chrome Extensions: HTML5 (often simple JavaScript), make browser do more
- PWA: Progressive Web Apps, websites that feel like native Android Apps
- Note: can deploy PWAs through Chrome Extension package (Google This)

## What is the Internet and Web Documents

Introductions to a Browser - Specifically Google Chrome (and other exist)
1. "What else can a browser do?"
   - https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/, accessed 20180905
   - A Browser can be a notepad tool, as long as the tab stays open
   - Type the following code into the URL Bar

   ```html
   data:text/html, <html contenteditable>
   ```

   - See: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/ for additional ideas on how to make a browser a Notepad

   - Uses built-in defaults for font, size, and other formatting rules
   - Google will spell check all the typing
   - If Chrome saves tabs (in settings, "Start where you left off"), or you use Workona, Tab will remain ready for notes but typing will disappear

2. Pathways inside a computer
   - Windows, Folders, and Pathways

3. Pathways outside a computer: URLs in name or number
   - Learning how to read URLs
   - Local Scripting: see example of Browser Notepad
   - Local Hosting: see example of World War II Essay on the Holocaust
   - Client-server hosting: see below

Exploring & Illustrating Internet and Web Docs Architecture
- Main Skill Goal: Using CMD through Windows to sending "Packets" or Internet Messages
- Main Concept Goal: diagram image of Internet Architecture (Google Draw, Paper and Pencil, other methods)
  1. One diagram for all vocabulary
  2. Internet Client-Server Requests through 2 stub networks (2x switches with single router)
- Main Vocabulary for Client-server relationships of Real (MAC) Addressing and Logical Addressing
  - workstations & NIC Cards (real MAC Address)
  - stub networks (defined by 1 workstation & switch or 1 workstation & router)
  - LANs defined by switch
  - WANs defined by router (edge router)
  - MANs defined by region or provider
  - Backbone of Internet defined by "in the wild" routers
- Main Vocabulary for Internet Services Requests ("all at once" (Netflix), packets (checked))
  - DNS
  - Pathways
  - Browser
  - EMail Server
  - Print Server
- Main Commands Examples for CMD

# To Include

Intermediate HTML5 Additional Notes & Progress to Consider
- Develop Ideas about Variables and Data Structures
- Write Functions (non-return, return, nested)
- Develop outcomes about computation, operators, etc.
- Introduce various ways of writing variables: arrays and objects
- Complete JavaScript Lessons outputted to the console, for prototyping
- Build HTML-JavaScript Interactions using a Submit Button to run a JavaScript Function called main()
  - Connected to OOP concept of constructors and classes, but in procedural programming
- Build individual webpages of HTML Form Data Content connected to JavaScript Assignments
- Build a website of all JavaScript Assignments
  - Demonstration of code and links necessary to run multiple HTML & JavaScript Pages
- Note: this will lead into writing and linking CSS files

Include full links to CSS in Boilerplate, with debugging Lines

Which Data Structure makes sense
- Primitive data: individually initialized
- Objects: multiple values for primitive data, called keys
- Arrays: multiple elements for primitive data, controlled by a numeral

Use Ternary Operator as Full Solution

Use Forms to Input data

See: https://css-tricks.com/helping-a-beginner-understand-getting-a-website-live/

CSS lessons
- One page with different .class attributes, simple HTML
- Remember CSS Validation and Accessibility

Video 5 Notes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wxRnsmNGpc&feature=youtu.be
- Making a Table: rows, colspan, rowspan (i.e. weekly schedule)
- Adding CSS to Table: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_table.asp
- More CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_tables.asp
- Example cell: font, font weight, color, background-color
- Note: background-color changes can increase contrast, making reading easier (not on white background)
- Note: in aXe validator, will analyze color contrast in Learn More
- Note: Checking Accessibility

Video 6 Notes
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGwKOxh5hqQ&feature=youtu.be

This video developing a Form, what else needs to happen in Introductory?

Notes
- First build a Form
- Second, add colour with Style Sheets
- First is line to make sure nothing happens, for testing

- ensures nothing happens on the "x" html page, that doesn't exist

Build a Form in HTML: all typing is in Video, review the video again to add all the typing

Go to paletton.com; or http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

Get the triad and complimentary colours: time is about 7 minutes

Click on "Triad" and "Add Complimentary"

Look at definition for Compliementary Colour (opposite side of colour wheel)

Able to turn the colour wheel until we find colours we like, and can make darker or lighter

To get the colours, click on

Tables, Export

Colour List as CSS

Copy the first 3 Lines, including URL for Colour Scheme, paste into CSS File as reference

Pick the colours wanted, must pick the same numbers (all 0, or 1, or 2)

Make comments about primary, secondary, etc.

Copy the css export

create comment into css file

next create the foreground and background colours, then make sure they pass accessibility

Test the contrast using another Tool from aXe

https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/2.2/color-contrast?application=lighthouse

find one of colours to get the highest contrast ratio

Next, play with lightness of colours : changes hue and saturation

Question: do you want light on dark, or dark on light?

Make Comments about the new colours we will have

Continue to choose colours for the entire page

Colour Wheel: warm and cool colours
