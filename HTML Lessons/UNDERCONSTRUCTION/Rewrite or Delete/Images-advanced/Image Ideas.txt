Image Ideas

Note: inline vs. block images
•	Using CSS will do the same thing
Img { display: block; }
•	Responsive Images: will never go beyond the width set to the screen’s container
img { width: 100%; height: auto: }

Other img attributes
•	srcset: defines multiple sizes of the same image allowing browser to select the most appropriate size
•	height & width: identifies the intrinsic height and width of an image in CSS pixels
•	usemap: specifies a client-side image to be used with the image
•	ismap: defines server-side image map, needs mouse coordinates too
•	longdesc: defines a URL where more information can be found by the image (does this work?)

Note: try <picture> to specify the different image designs for different contexts
