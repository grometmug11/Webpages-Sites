Consuming Paragraphs

Paragraphs or “readable” text
Various types of readable text depending on our expectations of “summary” or “narrative”
(story, lots of ideas all at once)
Caution: consuming paragraphs is the most difficult
Hint: Paragraphs are probably the reason it is taught most often, and repeated most often

Planning Idea: Legend for tags and formatting
•	CSS file formatting
•	Written into HTML formatting type
•	Scaffold what a good DOC looks like
•	Create templates or DOC types
•	“Code formatting requirements beforehand”

Planning Idea – evaluate if this will work
•	Ask for paragraph from Stacia
•	Give her an example
•	Have students highlight out ordered and unordered lists, outline headings, and other summary ideas
•	Have students find images and other information (like word definitions)
	and can be created into a website
	(Google Word Definitions, Wikipedia, other websites, personal experiences loaded up, images, other web pages)
•	This should help easing the comprehension of the paragraph
