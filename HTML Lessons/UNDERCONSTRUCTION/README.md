# HTML Lessons
Starting HTML Lessons, linking HTML Pages that illustrate different lessons

**Purpose:** build simple webpages that are linked to each other, rendered in a browser
- All can be opened in ATOM and rendered in a browser to visualize lesson material

*Purpose of this website is a teaching lesson of what is explained in the ReadMe File*

Progressions
- Simple HTML Boilerplate illustrated in Hello World with inline CSS
- *Creating a Child Template*
- *Creating a Simple Text-hyperlinked Splashpage*, optional to include images, etc. & Remember two click rule
  - this page will illustrate differences in formatting text with HTML Tags

Creating a Child Template - planning required
- Introductory HTML Boilerplate with Semantic Tags for hearing impaired
  - Tab Title
  - Meta Data entry, See MetaData Exemplar
  - Footer and Quote, See FooterBlockQuote Exemplar

Creating Splash Page and linking to different childPages with a tags and `href=""` with options
- Creating Organized and unorganized lists (i.e. on Splash Page as summary)
- Another Page (see exemplar): Comparing Heading and Paragraph TagsH1 - H7, combining with Semantic Tags
- Another Page (see exemplar): Sub and Super Script Tags
- Another Page, formatting example (see exemplar): Delete this DIVs, HTML_BoilerplateDIV_v1, HTML_BoilerplateDIV_v2
- Image Lessons
  - See example: Image.html
  - See Image Lessons in childPages Exemplars
  - See Images Folder for other examples
- See HTML Summary, what has not been made into example pages, what needs to be

Note: rewrite current website to learn about webpages

Note: Review Chrome's inspection elements to learn about how a webpage is laid out

## Progressions & Additional Notes

Hello World with inline CSS
- only simple boilerplate

**NOTE**: each example will illustrate
- HTML Tag Anatomy (Angle Brackets), typed backwards, then text content added later
  - Single & Auto closing, like image: <>
  - Regular: <></>
  - Attributes & Attribute Values
  - Default Attribute Values if no values are specifies
- WHITE Space writing with "double"-enter to enable easier reading, instead of on one line
  - Compilers in Browsers do not read WHITE SPACE ... that is for WYSIWYG and Humans reading
- HTML Comments (use these often)

HTML Semantic Tags & Boiler Plate: Meta Data
- Change the values in the <head>
- Create a link from index.html to MetaData.html

META Data - Prepares the body for searching and rendering in browser
- Google Search to see use of UTF-8
- Other Meta Data used in HEAD
- Web Browsers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser
- Browsers need to read what language is declared first
- Different browser versions will run different versions of languages differently
- QE Runs the latest versions of all
- Other countries do not - web developers must test website versions on a variety of monitor sizes, browsers, language versions

HTML Semantic Tags & Boiler Plate: Footer
- Quote with Hyperlink opening new Tab
- Blockquote URL Reference with Date Accessed

```JAVA
<blockquote cite="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mitchell_kapor_163583">
    <!--  Date Accessed: 20180920 -->
    <p><strong>"Getting information off the Internet is like taking a drink from a firehose."</strong>
      <em><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/mitchell_kapor_163583" target="_blank">- Mitch Kapor</a></em></p>
    <p>&copy Mark Mercer, powered by MercersKitchen in GitHub</p>
    <!-- Note: symbols in text get confused with HTML symbols, text-based symbols exist -->
```

HTML Semantic Tags & Boiler Plate: Body
- Note: auto formatting tags (preset in browser, user controlled)
- **Learn Pieces of HTML Sematic Tags and boilerplate while learning auto formatting**
- Learn File Navigation in index.html with hyperlinks to childPages
- Visualize HTML Layout with DIVs
- Auto Formatting Example Pages
  - Headings vs. Paragraph DOC (includes <br>)
    - H1 - H7, p
    - Includes <br>
  - Ordered and Unordered Lists (simple formatting & more HTML Options)
  -

Review all pages and visualize where the HTML Sections are using DIVs and inline CSS

#### Ideas
Where does inline CSS get added in this list

Redo Previous auto formatted DOCs with inline CSS (inline rewrites HTML)
Note: CSS Section and File Overwrite Options

- Paragraph formatting: copy and past for Essay Project
- Essay's are the most difficult to read ... probably taught the most in all subjects
- Using hyperlinks in paragraphs: a-tag with href attribute

- Simple Ordered and Unordered List Page
- Using More attributes page

- Hyperlinks & Images-Intro
- img-tag and src attribute
- img-tag with altattributre (visually imparted and website code, semantic, is read to person to "see" website)
- Advanced Images

- Introductory Example for Essay Planning, Example #2

- Intermediate Business Page Website, after CSS Lessons, Developing a Splash Page: See Example 1

- Construct Essay Project
- Refer to HTML Summary
- Create Interactive Essay Project
