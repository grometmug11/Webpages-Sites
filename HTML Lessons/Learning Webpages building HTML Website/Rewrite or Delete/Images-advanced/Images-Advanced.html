URL Can point inside or outside client comptuer
Element called Called self-closing element,
also null meaning no text, and is in-line with text.

Best Practice: every image has a brief text description.>

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title></title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>What does in-line mean for images?</h1>
    <p>This image clicks to the same page and is from online.</p>
    <a href="#" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" /></a>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>When a text is in-line <a href="#" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/web-101/web101-image_brownbear.jpg" /></a>
    , text continues. Notice, the format of the image creates the space of the text's line.</p>
    <p>"BR" can hep with this and so can .css files.</p>

    <h1>What does alt mean for images</h1>
    <P>If an image fails to load, or a program uses a speaking tool,
    text can be used as a alternative.</p>
    <p>For example</p>
    <img src="#" alt="A field of yellow sunflowers" />
  </body>
</html>

<!Note: inline means no page break and text continues.
Might need br to break up text around images.>

<!Note about referencing online resources.
Record the URL and time you found it.
Not saving online resources means storage can be used for other things.>
